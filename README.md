# K-Means-Clusterings-Projects
Code for determining optimal number of clusters for K-means algorithm using the 'elbow criterion'
Clustering analysis can be done on the basis of features where we try to find subgroups of samples based on features or on the basis of samples where we try to find subgroups of features based on samples. Clustering is used in market segmentation; where we try to find customers that are similar to each other whether in terms of behaviors or attributes, i where we try to group similar regions together.
